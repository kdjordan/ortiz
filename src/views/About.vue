      Trained in the classical drawing and sculptural methods passed down over millennia, Randy has amassed extensive knowledge of long-established design principals and techniques trusted throughout humanitiesâ€™ imaginative evolution. Working apace with contemporary building trends in wide ranging mediums has allowed Randy to successfully envision a channel between modern design esthetics and those of antiquity.
